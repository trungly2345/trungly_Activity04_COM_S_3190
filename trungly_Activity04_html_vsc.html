            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <p style="justify-content: center;">In August 2024, I began my first internsip at National Carwash Solution working on mobile app and 
                web app. I was responsible for maintaining the codebase and bug fixes on the front-end. I worked in a team the consists of 
                4 developers and 1 graphic designer that is lead by a lead product owner in Agile environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my internship, I learned how to work in a team with other developers. I was fortunate enough to be mentored by a Software developer that helped me grow as a developer and improve my front-end skills. 
                I also learned how to use Jira and Slack messagin application to keep track of my work and communicate with my team.

        <p class="project-text style=">
            <p class="portfolio-heading">Personal Portfolio</p>
            This is a project I work using HTML and CSS only for my class, I created a header navigation that consists homepage, about me, projects and contact me section.
            This is my very first project that I use HTML and CSS. Although this project was done in class, I decided to revamp the overall web-design and improve the interface of the website outside of class.<br></br>
            I wanted to keep the design simple and easier for the user to navigate through the website. I learned the simple web design principles is the key to a good user experience. I don't want anything distracting the user from the content of the website. <br></br>
